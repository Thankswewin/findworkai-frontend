# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions üöÄ

Your code is now ready to be pushed to GitHub! Follow these steps:

## Option 1: Using GitHub Website (Easiest)

1. **Go to GitHub.com**
   - Navigate to https://github.com
   - Sign in to your account (or create one if you don't have one)

2. **Create a New Repository**
   - Click the green "New" button or go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `findworkai-frontend`
   - Description: "FindWorkAI - AI-Powered Business Discovery Platform by Pheelymon"
   - Keep it **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
   - **DON'T** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have them)
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Push Your Code**
   After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Run these in your terminal:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/Thankswewin/findworkai-frontend.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Option 2: Using GitHub CLI

If you want to use GitHub CLI, first install it:

### Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
winget install --id GitHub.cli
```

Or download from: https://cli.github.com/

### After installing:
```bash
# Login to GitHub
gh auth login

# Create repository and push
gh repo create findworkai-frontend --public --source=. --remote=origin --push --description "FindWorkAI - AI-Powered Business Discovery Platform by Pheelymon"
```

## Option 3: Using Git Commands Only

If you already created an empty repository on GitHub:

```bash
# Add remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/Thankswewin/findworkai-frontend.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push code
git push -u origin main
```

## After Pushing

Once your code is on GitHub:

1. **Add Repository Topics** (for discoverability):
   - `nextjs`
   - `typescript`
   - `react`
   - `tailwindcss`
   - `ai`
   - `lead-generation`
   - `saas`

2. **Enable GitHub Pages** (optional, for docs):
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Pages
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: main, folder: /docs (if you have docs)

3. **Set Up GitHub Actions** (for CI/CD):
   - The repository is already configured for testing
   - You can add `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for automated testing

4. **Add Branch Protection** (recommended):
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Branches
   - Add rule for `main` branch
   - Enable: Require pull request reviews
   - Enable: Require status checks

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
If you get authentication errors:
```bash
# Set up personal access token
# Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens
# Generate new token with 'repo' scope
# Use token as password when prompted
```

### SSL Certificate Issues
```bash
git config --global http.sslVerify false
# Note: Only use temporarily, re-enable after pushing
git config --global http.sslVerify true
```
